# Proposed Outline

drafted by meng and circulated to Oliver and Harry, Susan and Roland

## Part I: Introduction

1. remind everybody of the CompK / CompLaw ("CK/CL") twin visions of CodeX:
   - Computational Law is that branch of legal informatics concerned with the mechanization of legal analysis (whether done by humans or machines). It emphasizes explicit behavioral constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct. Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing. While the idea of mechanized legal analysis is not new, its prospects are better than ever due to recent technological developments - including progress in Computational Logic, the growth of the Internet, and the proliferation of autonomous systems (such as self-driving cars and robots).
   - The Computable Contracts project works on developing a universal Contract Definition Language that will allow terms and conditions to be represented in machine-understandable way. As a result, computers will be able to process and reason over the contracts automatically with a guaranteed degree of accuracy. The effect is not only a significant reduction of legal transaction costs, but it also opens a variety of new options to create better contracts.
2. survey the "state of the union" for 2018: describe briefly what has happened in the field, what's going on now, and how it all fits into the CodeX vision

## Part II: Use Cases

- introduce a use-case approach so we stay grounded and don't disappear up the ivory tower, off into the clouds
- show how certain players in the field are already satisfying some of these use cases in an ad-hoc manner: e.g. Joshua Browder
- shout out to a couple of other stanford projects e.g. http://corpuslegis.stanford.edu/homepage/index.php, https://protege.stanford.edu/, maybe worksheets
- for some of the remaining-open use cases, offer concrete examples of how CK/CL changes the world for that use case
- specify out-of-scope approaches â€“ particularly the Dionysian tradition of case-based Machine Learning which is doing good work, e.g. Luminance / Kira, just not our kind of work

## Part III: Requirements

- outline requirements in common for CompK/CompLaw solutions across use cases
- for example, these are some high-level requirements at the "principles" level:
  - expressiveness of constitutive vs prescriptive(regulative) rules
  - editability: as code, in an IDE, not in Word, or even in a diagrammatic isomorphism
  - explainability: when the software makes a decision it should be able to explain it
  - extraction from/to natural language, providing compatibility with the legacy world of legal writing
  - accessibility: the solution can be embedded into an expert system behind a chatbot; show Joshua Browder's approach
- specify a very small minimum viable prototype use case
- outline requirements for how the CompK/CompLaw approach should handle that first use case

## Part IV: Solutions

- for the sake of not reinventing the wheel, link these requirements to existing available solutions
  - semantic reasoners
  - natural language engines e.g. GF
  - the UML tradition from OMG: BPMN / BPEL / SBVR / DMN
  - the XML tradition from OASIS: LegalRuleML
  - Prolog and DataLog, Flora / Ergo
  - existing contract languages (mostly academic)

- write a narrative about how different user categories interact with the solution
  - how do developers build it?
  - what infrastructural software do they choose to use? what choices do they make?
  - where interpretation is needed, how do lawyers / legislators review / approve interpretations?
  - how do users interact with the system?
  - do those interactions fulfill the requirements?

- _If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea._

## Part V: Original Work

- identify gaps in the space of available solutions, and explain how those gaps motivate new R&D in specific domains
- make as much progress as we can on filling those gaps; this is actual work and will need resources of a kind different to just writing the paper
